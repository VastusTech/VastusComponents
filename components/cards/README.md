# Cards

Cards represent a preview of an object, showing only a little information about
the object. For instance, if you want to look through a big list of your friends
they would be displayed as cards.

You need to fetch everything for the Cards before you display them, so that you
can batch fetch them all at once (as in with a query).

The fetch lists are stored in "______CardInfo".
